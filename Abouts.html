      <h1>So, who am I ?</h1>
  
      <p>
        My name is Noémie Dublanc and I'm passionate about the world of code. 
        Originally from France, I'm currently a first-year computer science student at Ynov Campus. 
        This year has been a real exploration for me in the vast field of computer science. <br>
        <br>
        Over the course of my studies, I've had the opportunity to dabble in a variety of areas, 
        from network configuration to object-oriented programming, game development on Unity and much more. 
        I have enthusiastically experimented with languages such as Java, C++, Golang, Html, 
        Css and have acquired a solid grounding in these areas.<br>
        <br>
        What I appreciate most in the world of development is the possibility of creating something from nothing, 
        bringing projects to life and solving problems. Although I don't yet know what sector I'd like to specialize in, 
        I'm open to all possibilities and can't wait to explore this exciting field further.<br>
        <br>
        Outside my studies, I also enjoy immersing myself in various personal projects and exploring new fields. 
        I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning and am constantly striving to improve my skills and deepen my knowledge.<br>
        <br>
        If you have any questions, exciting projects or just want to chat about anything related to the world of code, 
        please don't hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you!
